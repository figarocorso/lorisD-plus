You may be familiar with Chrome extensions that replace all images on webpages with themed pictures. While this is humorous for a short time, victims quickly realize that they've been pranked and promptly disable the extension, ending the fun prematurely.

Enter lorisD+! This extension allows you to implement a more subtle strategy by specifying the percentage of images that you would like to be replaced, rather than bluntly replacing all images. Add this extension to a friend or co-worker's browser and laugh as adorable loris pictures randomly show up while they browse the web. It could be days or even weeks before they realize that something is up!

This evolution of the original concept includes a number of beneficial upgrades:
- customizable image replacement probability
- Image references that won't break over time
- Adorable loris images, or create your own custom library
- Improved image resizing and scaling

Originally based on the nCage extension concept.
